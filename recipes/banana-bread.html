    <h3>Desciption</h3>
    <p>Banana bread is a semi-sweet bread made with mashed 
        bananas as one of the principle ingredients. Most of 
        the breadâ€™s sweetness comes from the healthy sugars 
        naturally present in bananas, so it is considerably 
        healthier than other sweet baked goods that rely on 
        added sugars for their delectable taste.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flower</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>2 eggs (beaten)</li>
        <li>2 1/3 cups mashed overripe bananas</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Lightly grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine flour, baking soda, and salt in a large 
            bowl. Beat brown sugar and butter with an electric 
            mixer in a separate large bowl until smooth. Stir 
            in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. 
            Stir banana mixture into flour mixture until 
            just combined. Pour batter into the prepared 
            loaf pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick 
            inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 
            minutes. Let bread cool in pan for 10 minutes, then 
            turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
        </li>
    </ol>
